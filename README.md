# The Sudoku
## A nice sodoku solving environment made with tkinter

this is an app currently in beta version.

### Beta:
The beta version of this solving environment is one of my early project that I've created in 2020. The code inside are really messy, and it's nearly unreadable. With that being said, most of the function are working just fine, except there is sometimes some minor bugs happening when solving the board, which in most cases won't affect the solving process.

#### Features
- [x] Clean UI
- [x] Customizable theme
- [x] 3 difficulty of algorithm generated boards
- [x] Daily sudoku from http://dailysudoku.com/sudoku
- [x] Record every board you've done
- [x] Cell highlighting
- [x] Insert multiple candidates in one cell
- [ ] Multicolor cell marking
- [x] Play your own board
- [x] Save board for later

### Remake
The remake version was made a year after the beta version had been released. My enthusiasm was came from the fact that I was getting ready for attending a sudoku competition back on the day, and later did I realise that the beta version wasn't a really ideal place for either grinding the board, or introducing new features and bug fixes to the game. So without hesitation, I decided to tare down all the old code, and create a new one from scratch.
