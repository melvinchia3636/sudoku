# The Sudoku
A nice sodoku solving environment made with tkinter, an ideal place for people to chill out and solve some awesome sudoku boards.

## Beta
The beta version of this solving environment is one of my early project that I've created in 2020, back on the day when the Covid-19 crisis was spreading all over around the world like a beast. The code inside are really messy, and it's nearly unreadable. With that being said, most of the function are working just fine, except there is sometimes some minor bugs happening when solving the board, which in most cases won't affect the solving process.

## Remake
The remake version was made a year after the beta version had been released. My enthusiasm was came from the fact that I was getting ready for attending a sudoku competition held by my high school, and later did I realise that the beta version wasn't a really ideal place for either grinding the board, or introducing new features and bug fixes to the game. So without hesitation, I decided to tare down all the old code, and create a new one from scratch.
