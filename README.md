# The Sudoku
A nice sodoku solving environment made with tkinter, an ideal place for people to chill out and solve some awesome sudoku boards.

## Beta
The beta version of this challenge environment was one of my earlier projects, which I started in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic was sweeping the globe like a beast. The code within is very jumbled and virtually unintelligible. With that stated, the most of the functions are operating well, with the exception of minor glitches that occasionally occur when solving the board, which in most cases will not hinder the solution process.

## Remake
The remake version was developed a year after the beta version was released. My enthusiasm stemmed from the fact that I was preparing for a high school sudoku contest, only then did I realise that the beta version was no longer suitable for introducing new features and bug fixes to the game since the source code was far too chaotic. Without hesitation, I chose to remove all of the previous code and rewrite it from the ground up.
